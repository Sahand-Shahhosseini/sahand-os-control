# TASK_COMMANDER (WHAT)

## Goal (one sentence)

## Context (why this matters)
- Link to the higher-level layer (L0–L11) and stage if known.
- If this is part of DOCSET_07 / DOCSET_14, state which DOC#.

## Scope (what is IN / OUT)
**IN**
- 

**OUT**
- 

## Outputs (artifacts to produce)
- Files to change/create (repo paths), or external pointers (local-only) if sensitive.

## DoD (Definition of Done)
- [ ] Output artifacts exist
- [ ] Acceptance checks listed and pass (fail-closed)
- [ ] If external review is required: reviewer pack + how feedback will be logged

## Constraints (non-negotiable)
- No CLI for the human executor (click-only)
- No secrets in cloud
- Fail-closed
- Minimal-scope changes

## Dependencies / blockers
- 

## Next step
- After this issue is accepted, open a **TASK_RUN_1_100** issue to execute it.
